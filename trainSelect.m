function [sp fp fn] = trainSelect(posc, negc, reps, htrain)
% Performs learning of the linear classifier (reps) times
% and selects the best classifier
% 	posc - samples of class which should be on the positive side of separating plane
% 	negc - samples of class which should be on the negative side of separating plane
% 	reps - number of repetitions of training
% 	htrain - handle to function computing separating plane
% Output:
% sp - coefficients of the best separating plane
% fp - false positive count (i.e. number of misclassified samples of pclass)
% fn - false negative count (i.e. number of misclassified samples of nclass)
